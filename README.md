# LIM
numerical calculation of 2D Larkin-Imry-Ma state.

Vector fields L and A with a constant amplitude;
A is chaotic;
L interacts with A: E=(L*A)^2;
L has gradient energy: E = Ug ((dL/dx)^2 + (dL/dy)^2)

One can start from some initial distribution of L and look for the equilibrium distribution of L. Ug is a control parameter.

Result:
picture1: start from uniform L, Ug goes up-down-up. Pair of vortices appear on the top:

picture2: start from L with a vortex, Ug goes up-down-up. The vortex is stable, two other pairs of vortices appear.
