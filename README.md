Numerical calculation of 2D Larkin-Imry-Ma state.

- Vector fields L and A, |L|=1;
- A is chaotic;
- L interacts with A: E = (L*A)^2;
- L has gradient energy: E = Ug ((dL/dx)^2 + (dL/dy)^2).

One can start from some initial distribution of L and look for the
equilibrium distribution of L. Ug is a control parameter.

Result:

picture1: start from uniform L, gradient energy Ug goes up-down-up:

picture2: start from L with a vortex, Ug goes up-down-up. The vortex is stable:
